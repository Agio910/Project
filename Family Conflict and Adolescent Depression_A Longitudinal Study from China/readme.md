## Study Overview

This research examines the longitudinal relationships between family conflict and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents and their parents. Using data from three waves (2016-2020) of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), the study investigates how family conflict influences depressive symptoms and how these symptoms are transmitted across generations within families.

## Key Findings

- **Strong Association**: Family conflict showed a significant correlation with adolescents' depressive symptoms (r=0.580, p<0.001)
- **Bidirectional Relationship**: Adolescents' depressive symptoms exacerbated family conflict across the three waves
- **Intergenerational Transmission**: Mothers' depressive symptoms significantly influenced adolescents' depressive symptoms, while adolescents' depressive symptoms were transmitted to fathers' depressive symptoms
- **Maternal Education**: A mother's education level negatively predicted adolescents' depressive symptoms (Î²=-0.296, p<0.05)
- **Paternal Education**: A father's education level was positively associated with family conflict

## Methodology

The study analyzed data from 1,772 adolescents (mean age=12.4 in 2016) and their parents using:
- Multiple linear regression
- Latent growth models (LGM)
- Cross-lagged panel models (CLPM)

## Implications

These findings highlight the importance of family dynamics in adolescent mental health. They suggest that interventions aimed at reducing family conflict may help mitigate depressive symptoms across generations. In the Chinese cultural context, where family relationships emphasize hierarchy and filial piety, understanding these dynamics is particularly important for developing effective mental health interventions.


This research contributes to our understanding of how family environments influence adolescent depression and offers insights for developing targeted family-based interventions to improve mental health outcomes.
